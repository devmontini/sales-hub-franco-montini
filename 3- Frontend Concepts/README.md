# 3-Front-End Concepts

a) Create a web page. You can use pure HTML or a front-end framework. Bonus if you use a client-side router. If you use a framework, make sure it DOES NOT include stylesheets (e.g. no Bootstrap). You can use utilities stylesheets (e.g. tailwind).
b) On the web page, create a carousel from scratch.

-     The carousel will have five sections; each will explain, in your own words, what the different position values in CSS mean (static, relative, absolute, fixed, sticky), and in which cases you would use them effectively.
-     The carousel should be vertically and horizontally centered.
-     The carousel should NOT have a fixed width or height; it should depend on its content.
-     The carousel should be responsive (use your best judgement).
